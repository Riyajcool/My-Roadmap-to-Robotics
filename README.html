Let's start with basics, as we're looking to switch so would need to be clear on fundamental concepts of course! 
 
Programming language  
Free courses on the Construct should be a good way to start, being the use case for Robotics.. 
C++ for Robotics  
 
C++ Advance concepts on Udemy with exercises 
OR  
C++ Learning path on LinkedIn (If still in-depth knowledge needed) 
 
At this point, taking challenges on hacathon or solving leetcode exercises to practice in C++ 
 
Note : Plus point being in TCS, have free access to Udemy, LinkedIn, O'Reilly resources ðŸ˜Š 
 
Going in-depth with Code-along series on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssJde6l7mrM 
 
Getting recap of Python with hands-on : Linked-in course 
And Python for Robotics â€“ The Construct 
 
Starting Hacathon or challenges on python 
 
For now, getting strong grip on C++ . So not deep diving much in Python. 
 
Understanding linux : 
Linux for Robotics â€“ the Construct  
 
 
Starting with ROS (Still working on resources) 
ROS concepts  
Taking a simple project to stay motivated 
 
Starting with Maths and Kinematics involved in Robotics 
Taking an intermediate project to apply the concepts
